<!-- Intrinsic growth rate --> 

## What if annual rates vary over time?

## Team exercise
* Demonstrate that when gains and losses vary among years that average gets you to the same place?
* Do as a table exercise 
* Then run in STELLA to confirm
* Objective- to set the stage for population dependent rates.
* Have them run out dynamics that go negative.

## Intrinsic growth rate

Balance of gains and losses

Gains-losses=intrinsic growth rate..

## Team exercise
* Spreadsheet exercise
* Calculate what the intrinsic growht rate is 
* Forecast over 10 years. goes negative!
* Have a population that goes negative
* Scratcher

<!-- Dependent gains and losses --> 

## Exponential population model
$$ \frac{dB}{dt}=r \cdot b $$

## Assumptions
$$ \frac{dB}{dt}=r \cdot b $$

* Growth rate versus abundance
* dB increases with B

## Biologically reasonable?
* dA/dt/B increases with B
* Team exercise-

## Population limits?
* What?  Why. habitat

## Carrying capacity
* Resources limitation.. Could be habitat, could be food, could be.

## Team exercise
* What could limit the Biomass of a population?
* Abundance?

<!-- Logistic model --> 

## Graham-Schaefer model
Plot of dynamics over tim

$$ \frac{dB}{dt}=r \cdot b \cdot \frac{K-B}{K} $$

## Graham-Schaefer model
Insert box and flow diagram

$$ \frac{dB}{dt}=r \cdot b \cdot \frac{K-B}{K} $$

## Assumptions
* Plot of per capita growth versus abundance+
* Fox
* Pella-Tomlison

## Team exercise
* ????

## Adding harvest

## Surplus production
* Compensatory growth
